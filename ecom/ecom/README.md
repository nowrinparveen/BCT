
Hello, as a part of our 10 day BCT training we were asked to prepare a fully functional website using Python With Django.
In this process we learn a lot of new things which will help us in future to develop new projects.
We created an e-commerce website which would sell Anime Merchandise. For the user interface part we used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
For the backend we used the Django of python which comes with many wonderful features like a built in database, sql etc.
Check the repository given for the excitingÂ website!!
